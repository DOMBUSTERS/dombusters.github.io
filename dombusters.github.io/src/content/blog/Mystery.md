## Description
Author: Michael

I received this message, a fascinating enigma:
```
rkenr wozec gtrfl obbur bfgma fkgyq ctkvq zeucz hlvwx yyzat zbvns kgyyd sthmi vsifc ovexl zzdqv slyir nwqoj igxuu kdqgr fdbbd njppc mujyy wwcoy
```
These settings were provided:
- 3 Rotor Model
- Rotor 1: VI, Initial: A, Ring A
- Rotor 2: I, Initial: Q, Ring A
- Rotor 3: III, Initial L, Ring A
- Reflector: UKW B
- Plugboard: BQ CR DI EJ KW MT OS PX UZ GH

## Solution
The challenge has conveniently provided all the necessary information to decode the ciphertext. 

We turn to an online tool to decrypt a ciphertext using an enigma machine: 
[Enigma Machine Decryptor](https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine)

After decryption, the plaintext seems strange at the first glance.

Upon closer review, it becomes apparent that the words are improperly separated. Resolving that issue, we get the following comprehensible message and consequently, our flag. 

> message wrapped in light hidden deeper out of sight locking it more tightly anyway your flag is here flag fdfeabcacbebfbadaefbeccaadddbafezzz

Flag: `flag{fdfeabcacbebfbadaefbeccaadddbafe}`
